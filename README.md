 Seva+ ‚Äî Smart Sanitation & Crowd Management Platform
 Built for Simhastha 2028 Hackathon

Seva+ is a realtime sanitation and crowd management system designed to handle the massive scale of the Simhastha festival in Ujjain, where millions of pilgrims gather.
Our platform empowers admins, staff, and the public to work together ‚Äî keeping the city cleaner, safer, and smarter.

 Problem We Solve

 Sanitation Worker Overload ‚Üí Current ratio is 1 worker per 18 toilets (ideal is 1:8).
 Unclean Toilets & Waste ‚Üí Overflowing bins and poor maintenance.
