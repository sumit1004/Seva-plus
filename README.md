 Seva+ — Smart Sanitation & Crowd Management Platform
 Built for Simhastha 2028 Hackathon

Seva+ is a realtime sanitation and crowd management system designed to handle the massive scale of the Simhastha festival in Ujjain, where millions of pilgrims gather.
Our platform empowers admins, staff, and the public to work together — keeping the city cleaner, safer, and smarter.

Problem We Solve
The Simhastha festival puts extreme pressure on Ujjain’s infrastructure:

 River Pollution → Floral waste, plastics, and bottles pollute the Kshipra.
 Sanitation Worker Overload → Current ratio is 1 worker per 18 toilets (ideal is 1:8).
 Unclean Toilets & Waste → Overflowing bins and poor maintenance.
 Water Shortages → Locals face scarcity, pilgrims struggle to find water points.
 
Our Solution — Seva+
Seva+ combines technology + realtime data to address these problems:

 Admin Dashboard → Manage staff, teams, shifts, facilities, and issues in one place.
 Realtime Analytics → Live charts for crowd density, tasks, facilities, and emergencies.
 Staff & Team Management → Bulk upload, assign work, send instant notifications.
 QR-Enabled Maps → Public can scan QR codes to find toilets, water kiosks, dustbins, and routes.
 Issue & Emergency Reporting → Pilgrims report problems instantly; admins dispatch staff.
 Notification Center → Send alerts via SMS/WhatsApp/Email to individuals or teams.
 Announcements & Ads → Publish festival updates and sponsor ads.
